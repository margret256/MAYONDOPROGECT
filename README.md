Mayondo Wood & Furniture Business System -
Project Report
1. Introduction
Mayondo Wood & Furniture is a small but growing workshop specializing in the production and sale
of wooden furniture. As the business expanded, managing records such as sales, stock, finances,
and customer orders manually became difficult. This project was developed to create a simple
web-based system to help manage daily operations more efficiently.
2. Problem Statement
The business faced several challenges before introducing the system:
- Poor record keeping (manual books easily got lost or damaged).
- Low employee accountability due to lack of clear records.
- Difficulty in tracking stock, inputs, and outputs.
- Customers lacked an easy way to place and track orders.
- Managers struggled with monitoring finances, sales, and customer data in real time.
3. Objectives of the System
- Provide a login and registration system for different roles (Admin, Manager, Employee/Attendant,
Customer).
- Create separate dashboards so each role only sees the information relevant to them.
- Automate sales recording (calculate totals and update tables).
- Maintain accurate stock levels by updating when new products arrive.
- Store and track customer orders and details.
- Provide the Manager with financial reports, sales summaries, and customer records.

5. Design

both desktop and mobile use.
6. Technology Used
